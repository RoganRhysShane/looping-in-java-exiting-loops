/**
 * For this exercise you will write a simple main() method that prints out the
 * following text:
 * <p>
 * 1
 * 2 2
 * 4 4 4 4
 * 5 5
 * 6 6 6 6 6 6
 * <p>
 * Note the following facts:
 * <p>
 * - 3 is not output at all
 * - 5 is only output twice
 * - You are required use nested for loops (not while loops)
 * - You will need to use both the "break" and continue "keywords"
 * - Each number is followed by a space. EG: 2_2_, not 2_2.
 * <p>
 * The test is picky about formatting so make sure you get it right. Ask
 * questions if something is unclear.
